# Logical foundations

### Proving an implication 

- "If $p$ is true, then $q$ is also true."
- Notation: $p \Rightarrow q$

For example:

- If $n$ is an odd number, then $2n$ is an even number.
- If it rains, then the ground gets wet.

### Caveat

*$p \Rightarrow q$ does not mean that $q \Rightarrow p$!*

For example:

- If the ground is wet, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's raining.
- For $n = 10$, $2n = 20$ is even, but $10$ is not odd.


# Direct proof techniques

### Technique 1: direct proof

- Start from $p$, then work your way to $q$.
- This is how we've constructed most proofs so far.

Example:

- In words: *For each positive real number $x$, there exists a real number $y$ such that $y(y+1) = x$.*
- Mathematically: $\forall x > 0 \in \mathbb{R} \Rightarrow \exists y \in \mathbb{R}: y(y+1) = x$.

# Indirect proof techniques

### Technique 2: Proof by contraposition

- "If $p$ then $q$" is logically equivalent to "if not $q$ then not $p$".
- Start from "not $q$", work towards "not $p$".
- Mind the direction of the implication!

Example: Show that if $n^2$ is even (for $n$ a natural number), then $n$ is also even.

### Caveat: negating a logical statement

De Morgan's laws:

- not ($p$ and $q$) = (not $p$) or (not $q$)
- not ($p$ or $q$) = (not $p$) and (not $q$)

Example: Show that if $x^2 \ne 1$, then $x \ne \pm 1$.

### Technique 3: Proof by contradiction

- Assume that $q$ is not true, start from $p$, and work towards a contradiction.
- If a contradiction is found, our starting assumption must have been false, and therefore $q$ is true.

Example: Prove that if $x^2 = 2x$ and $x \ne 0$, then $x = 2$.

### Proving an equivalence

- "$p$ holds if and only if (iff) $q$ holds."
- Notation: $p \Leftrightarrow q$

Proving an equivalence means proving two implications: $p \Rightarrow q$ and $q \Rightarrow p$.

Example: Prove that $n^2$ is even if and only if $n$ is even.

### Proving a single statement

Example: Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

### Technique 4: Proof by case enumeration

- Split statement into subcases, prove each case separately.
- Don't forget any subcases!

Example: Show that for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, $|xy| = |x||y|$.

# Proof by induction

### Technique 5: Proof by induction

- Prove that a statement $P(n)$ holds for every natural number $n$.
- Proceeds in two steps:
  - Prove a *base case*, usually $P(1)$.
  - Prove the *induction step*: if $P(k)$ holds, then $P(k+1)$ holds too.

Example: Show that the sum of the first $n$ numbers is equal to $\displaystyle \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$:
$$
	1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
$$

### Example

Show that the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is equal to $n^2$:
$$
	1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n - 1) = n^2.
$$
