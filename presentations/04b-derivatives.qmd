### Implicit differentiation

- We now know how to compute the derivative of a function $y = f(x)$.

- But what if we can't write $y$ as a function of $x$?

Example: Find $y'(x)$ if $x$ and $y$ are related by $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. 

Two ways of solving:

1. The direct way (hard): find $y(x)$ and differentiate
2. Via **implicit differentiation** (easy): differentiate both sides

### Example

Find an equation for the tangent line to the curve defined by $x^2 + xy + 2y^3 = 4$ at the point $P(-2, 1)$.

### Velocity and acceleration

We will consider only objects moving along a straight line (one-dimensional motion)

- Position $x(t)$
- Velocity $v(t)$ 

Recall from physics 1: $v(t)$ is the **first derivative** of $x(t)$. Why?

### Average and instantaneous velocity, speed

- The *average velocity* $v_\text{avg}(t)$ over an interval $[t, t+h]$ is the change in distance divided by the change in time:
$$
    v_{\text{avg}}(t) = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{x(t+h) - x(t)}{h}.
$$
- The *instantaneous velocity* $v(t)$ is the limit as $h \to 0$:
$$
    v(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{x(t+h) - x(t)}{h} = \frac{dx}{dt} = \dot{x}(t).
$$
- The *speed* $s(t)$ is the magnitude of the velocity: $s(t) = |v(t)|$.


### Characteristics of velocity

- $v(t) > 0$: moving to the **right** ($x(t)$ increases)
- $v(t) < 0$: moving to the **left** ($x(t)$ decreases)
- $v(t) = 0$: instantaneously at rest

### Acceleration

The **acceleration** $a(t)$ is the rate of change of the velocity:
$$
    a(t) = \dot{v}(t) = \ddot{x}(t).
$$

Characteristics:

- $a(t) > 0$: $v(t)$ increases
- $a(t) < 0$: $v(t)$ decreases

Speeding up and slowing down:

- $a(t) \cdot v(t) > 0$: speeding up
- $a(t) \cdot v(t) < 0$: slowing down

### Example

A particle $P$ moves along the $x$-axis with position given by $x(t) = 2 t^3 - 15 t^2 + 24t$.

1. Find $v(t)$ and $a(t)$.
2. In which direction is $P$ moving at $t = 2$? Is $P$ speeding up or slowing down?
3. When is $P$ instantaneously at rest? When does its velocity instantaneously not change?

### Example (continued)

4. When is $P$ moving to the left/right?
5. When is $P$ speeding up/slowing down?

### Example (continued)

```{python}
#|fig-align: center

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, (ax0, ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=3, figsize=(5, 4))
t = np.linspace(0, 5)
x = 2*t**3 - 15*t**2 + 24*t
v = 6*t**2 - 30*t + 24
a = 12*t - 30

ax0.set_title(r"Position $x(t) = 2t^3 - 15t^2 + 24 t$")
ax0.axhline(0, color="lightgray")
ax0.plot(t, x)

ax1.set_title(r"Velocity $v(t) = 6t^2 - 30t + 24$")
ax1.axhline(0, color="lightgray")
ax1.plot(t, v)

ax2.set_title(r"Acceleration $a(t) = 12t - 30$")
ax2.axhline(0, color="lightgray")
ax2.plot(t, a)

fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Historical aside

In the fall of 1972, President Nixon announced that "the rate of increase of inflation was decreasing". 

- Probably the first time a sitting president used the 3rd derivative.
- The 3rd derivative is also know as "jerk".
