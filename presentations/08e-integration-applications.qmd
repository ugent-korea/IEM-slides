# Area under curves

## Reminder: area under the curve

$$
    \text{Area} = \int_a^{c_1} f(x) dx - \int_{c_1}^{c_2} f(x) dx + \int_{c_2}^b f(x) dx.

# Area between curves

## Area between two curves

![](./images/09-integration/area-two-curves.svg){fig-align="center"}


## Recipe for finding the area

1. Make a figure
2. Determine intersection points
3. Figure out which curve is upper/lower
4. Integrate

## Example

Find the area bounded by $y = \sin x$, $y = 0$, and $\displaystyle x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.

## Example

Find the area of the region between the curves $y = x^2 - 2x$ and $y = 4 - x^2$.

## Example 

Find the area of the region between $x = 12 - y^2$ and $y = -x$.
