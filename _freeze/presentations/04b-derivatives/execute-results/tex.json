The direct way (hard): find $y(x)$ and differentiate\n2. Via **implicit differentiation** (easy): differentiate both sides\n\n### Example\n\nFind an equation for the tangent line to the curve defined by $x^2 + xy + 2y^3 = 4$ at the point $P(-2, 1)$.\n\n### \n\n![](./images/04-derivatives/implicit-curve.png){fig-align=\"center\" height=\"80%\"}\n\nFigure made with [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=plot+x%5E2+%2B+xy+%2B+2y%5E3+%3D+4).\n\n### Velocity and acceleration\n\nWe will consider only objects moving along a straight line (one-dimensional motion)\n\n- Position $x(t)$\n- Velocity $v(t)$ \n\nRecall from physics 1: $v(t)$ is the **first derivative** of $x(t)$. Why?\n\n### Average and instantaneous velocity, speed\n\n- The *average velocity* $v_\\text{avg}(t)$ over an interval $[t, t+h]$ is the change in distance divided by the change in time:\n$$\n    v_{\\text{avg}}(t) = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{x(t+h) - x(t)}{h}.\n$$\n- The *instantaneous velocity* $v(t)$ is the limit as $h \\to 0$:\n$$\n    v(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{x(t+h) - x(t)}{h} = \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\dot{x}(t).\n$$\n- The *speed* $s(t)$ is the magnitude of the velocity: $s(t) = |v(t)|$.\n\n\n### Characteristics of velocity\n\n- $v(t) > 0$: moving to the **right** ($x(t)$ increases)\n- $v(t) < 0$: moving to the **left** ($x(t)$ decreases)\n- $v(t) = 0$: instantaneously at rest\n\n### Acceleration\n\nThe **acceleration** $a(t)$ is the rate of change of the velocity:\n$$\n    a(t) = \\dot{v}(t) = \\ddot{x}(t).\n$$\n\nCharacteristics:\n\n- $a(t) > 0$: $v(t)$ increases\n- $a(t) < 0$: $v(t)$ decreases\n\nSpeeding up and slowing down:\n\n- $a(t) \\cdot v(t) > 0$: speeding up\n- $a(t) \\cdot v(t) < 0$: slowing down\n\n### Example\n\nA particle $P$ moves along the $x$-axis with position given by $x(t) = 2 t^3 - 15 t^2 + 24t$.\n\n1. Find $v(t)$ and $a(t)$.\n2. In which direction is $P$ moving at $t = 2$? Is $P$ speeding up or slowing down?\n3. When is $P$ instantaneously at rest? When does its velocity instantaneously not change?\n\n### Example (continued)\n\n4. When is $P$ moving to the left/right?\n5. When is $P$ speeding up/slowing down?\n\n### Example (continued)\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](04b-derivatives_files/figure-beamer/cell-2-output-1.pdf){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Historical aside\n\nIn the fall of 1972, President Nixon announced that \"the rate of increase of inflation was decreasing\". \n\n- Probably the first time a sitting president used the 3rd derivative.\n- The 3rd derivative is also know as \"jerk\".\n\n![](./images/04-derivatives/nixon.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\nSource: [Fermat's library](https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary/status/1644385429498494999)\n\n",
